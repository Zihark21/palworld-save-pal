              # Change this to the URL of your public server
              - PUBLIC_WS_URL=127.0.0.1:5174/ws
          ports:
            - "5174:5174"
          volumes:
            - ./data:/app/data
            - ./palworld_save_pal:/app/palworld_save_pal
          environment:

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Guide

For developers who want to contribute to Palworld Save Pal:

### Web

1. Set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   cd ui
   bun install
   bun run dev:web
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

### Desktop App

1. Set the environment variable for the svelte SPA `ui/.env`.

   ```env
   PUBLIC_WS_URL=127.0.0.1:5174/ws
   PUBLIC_DESKTOP_MODE=true
   ```

2. Activate python environment

   ```powershell
   uv sync
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Run the desktop app:

   ```powershell
   cd ui
   bun install
   bun run dev:desktop
   ```

### Build Desktop App

> Activate the environment

```powershell
uv sync
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Using build script

```powershell
.\build-desktop.ps1
```

#### Manual build

1. Set the environment variable for the svelte SPA `ui/.env`.

   ```env
   PUBLIC_WS_URL=127.0.0.1:5174/ws
   PUBLIC_DESKTOP_MODE=true
   ```

2. Build the SPA (replace bun with your package manager of choice). This will create a build directory in the project root containing the static files for the SPA:

   ```powershell
   cd ui
   bun install
   bun run build
   cd ..
   mkdir dist
   ```

3. Build standalone executable:

   ```powershell
   python setup.py build
   ```

or

3. Build installer:

   ```powershell
   python setup.py bdist_msi
   ```

> **Note:** The `dist` folder will contain the executable and the SPA build files, the data folder contains json files with game data, all need to be distributed together.

These are projects I've found that specifically target Palworld save files, each was helpful in some way during the development of this project:

- [PalEdit](https://github.com/EternalWraith/PalEdit) - PSP was inspired by it.
- [palworld-save-tools](https://github.com/cheahjs/palworld-save-tools) - PSP uses this tool for handling save files, can be used directly to convert to/from json.
- [palworld-uesave-rs](https://github.com/DKingAlpha/palworld-uesave-rs) - I originally considered building this app using Tauri, opted for using Python, but this project was helpful.
- [Palworld Pal Editor](https://github.com/KrisCris/Palworld-Pal-Editor) - Also served as a reference for Palworld Save Pal, adopted some of this projects approach.
- [PalWorldSaveTools](https://github.com/deafdudecomputers/PalWorldSaveTools) - Has a bunch of useful features for parsing, editing, and converting save files.
